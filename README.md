# Vizz Data challenge

Congratulations on recieving a Vizzuality data analysis challenge!
The purpouse of this challenge is to help us see:
* your current technical abilities
* your thought process
* your ability to use data to support an argument or tell a story
* And for you: to have a glimpse of the actual type of technical work we develop

Please feel-free to surprise us, and showcase any skills that you think are important!

If you feel like your analysis isn't perfect, don't worry. This is just
meant to be an exercise to help us gauge where you are in terms of your current capacity
and be a talking-point during the interview. A poor analysis will not necessarily
disqualify you from the job.

### The data
Our main focus right now are supply chains, and how they affect the big challenges we face: climate change, water&food security and biodiversity lost. 

We would like you to use one of the datasets we are familiar with: [Mapspam](https://www.mapspam.info/data/)

### The challenge

We would like you to analyse the data in relation to the areas of interest in the [areas.geojson](./areas.geojson) file and contextualize it.

At minimum we would like to see at least one map and a statistical chart.

### The tools
Use whatever ones you are comfortable with or you think are the best for the job.

### How should I deliver the results?
Add your results to your Github profile in a Jupyter notebook and be prepared to discuss them with us!

The technical solution is not the only thing that we value, also your approach and explanations.

### How much time should I spend?
As little as possible! We understand you probably have other duties so take your time.

### What if I have questions?
Emails us your questions at info@vizzuliaty.com
