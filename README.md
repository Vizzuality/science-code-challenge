# Vizz Data challenge

Congratulations on recieving a Vizzuality data analysis challenge!
The purpouse of this challenge is to help us see:
* your current technical abilities
* your thought process
* your ability to use data to support an argument or tell a story

Please feel-free to surprise us, and showcase any skills that you think are important!

If you feel like your analysis isn't perfect, don't worry. This is just
meant to be an exercise to help us gauge where you are in terms of your current capacity
and be a talking-point during the interview. A poor analysis will not necessarily
disqualify you from the job.

### Your Task:
Use Python to perform a simple analysis of the data table from the following url:
https://firms.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/active_fire/viirs/shapes/zips/VNP14IMGTDL_NRT_Global_7d.zip
We would like you to analyse the data in relation to the areas of interest in the ares.geojson file.
At minimum we would like to see at least one map and statistical chart.

### Hints and resources

Add your results to your Github profile in a Jupyter notebook and be prepared to discuss them with us!
If you don't have a github profile, and you don't know how to get started, we reccomend the following resources:

https://www.codecademy.com  (a nice git/github tutorial)
https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/ (Open source lessons for Science-flavoured people)


Possible libraries you may want to consider: pandas, geopandas, fiona, rasterio, shapely, folium

Metada for viirs

Extra practica hint:
If you have trouble setting-up your system, we reccomend using Anaconda Python.
https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/
Instructions on how to set-up your system for relevant Data Science can be found on Software Carpentries site.
